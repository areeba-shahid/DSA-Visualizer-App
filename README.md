# DSA-Visualizer-App
A comprehensive Data Structures and Algorithms project, showcasing implementations, visualizations, and real-world applications using pygame.

## Features
- **Implemented Data Structures:**
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables.
- **Implemented Algorithms:**
  - Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
  - Searching: Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.
  - Dynamic Programming: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Interactive visualizations for better understanding of algorithms.
- **Real-World Applications:**
  - Use cases of data structures and algorithms in real-world scenarios.
